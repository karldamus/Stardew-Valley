Please note that all the data inside this 'gamedata' folder is **strictly owned** by none 
other than Eric Barone otherwise known as @ConcernedApe. I, Karl Damus, fully acknowledge that I retain 
no ownership to this data. My purpose in using this data is in no way for any personal financial gain. 
These assets, obtained through means of unpacking the game Stardew Valley (which I bought for the full price 
on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/)), are being used for the soul purpose of this personal-project.

Additionally, these assets are merely data files. I have obtained no code from the original game. For one to
use these assets to illegally obtain the game would be **impossible** unless they were to add every line of code
themselves.

For more info on the creators of the game please see the folowing [credits.json](https://github.com/karldamus/StardewValley/blob/src/GameData/Strings/credits.json) file
